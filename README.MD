# Flatten function

```javasript
  [ 1, [ 2, [ 3 ] ], 4 ] -> [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

It is an algorithmic challenge to write a nested array flattening function. Three solutions are provided:

- naive recursive solution with forEach
- a little bit more modern, ES6-like solution with reduce function
- an iterative solution
